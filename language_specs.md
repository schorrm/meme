# MEME Specs and Language Standard

## A Meme Expression

A meme expression is formed from blocks. As of now there are three block hierarchies in the standard:

- C: Composite (this contains memes)
- M: Meme (denotes an image and its text)
- T: Text (a text block)
- WP: is a special case of Meme that puts white text before a meme (for image macros)

Scoping is C -> M -> T.

Formatting can be either included in a block or a block of its own. If it is its own block, it applies until the current scope is ended, if it is defined on the block, it applies throughout the scope.

For example, the following meme:

![This meme was generated by the compiler](docs/example_drake.png)

Is properly encoded as:

```meme
/M:drake/T:WYSIWYG/T:Entering weird crap into your console/
```

Where the termination of the M block is emplied by the end of the encoding.

Each block has a base tag (either a style tag to modify the style or a scoping type such as C, M, or T). Colons `:` chain together arguments in `TAG:required:optional` order, and then `;` ends tag arguments. So `/T:WYSIWYG:r1;F:impact:20/` denotes a Text block (T), WYSIWYG being the text (mandatory), followed by font styling of impact, 20pt.

## Reference of functions and args

Layout Tags:

- C: Composite 
    - Gridsize = colsxrows e.g. "2x3"
    - Gridlocation = col,row e.g. "1,2"

- M: Meme
    - Image (image is from the SML, local.image is from your current working directory)).
    - Size (resizes from the automatic image default)
    - Fillcolor
    - Resize mode: this probably won't work, but the params are resize (default), crop, and fill. Good luck.
- T: Text (a text block)
    - Text
    - Position is either:
        - a named location (r or l or none followed by) (bottom, right, top)
        - a column index like r3
        - an explicit bounding box like 20,30,200,400 or 20%,20%,50%,50%
    -e.g. `/T:foo:20,30,400,800/` or `/T:bar:rbottom/`
- WP: Whitespace prefix (for text):
    - Text (only param, you can still use `;` for scoped tags)

Format Tags:

- F: Font
    - fontface
    - fontsize
    - outlinesize
    - e.g. `/F:arial:20:5/`
- CL: Color (takes both hex and valid color names)
    - foreground
    - background
    - outline
- AL: Align
    - halign
    - valign
